### Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the public repo
git clone https://github.com/nirium-protocol/nirium-core.git
cd nirium-core

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development (frontend only - agent API is private)
pnpm dev
```

### Package Scripts

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `pnpm dev` | Start Next.js frontend (port 3000) |
| `pnpm build` | Build all public packages |
| `pnpm lint` | Lint all packages |
| `pnpm test` | Run all tests |
| `pnpm clean` | Clean build artifacts |
| `pnpm format` | Format code with Prettier |

## Contribution Guidelines

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/my-feature`
3. Make your changes
4. Run tests: `pnpm test`
5. Run linting: `pnpm lint`
6. Commit using conventional commits (see below)
7. Push and open a PR against `main`

Reviewers will not follow up for missing context - include a clear description of what changed and why.

### Commit Convention

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

| Prefix | Use for |
|--------|---------|
| `feat:` | New feature |
| `fix:` | Bug fix |
| `docs:` | Documentation only |
| `refactor:` | Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| `test:` | Adding or updating tests |
| `chore:` | Maintenance, tooling, CI |

### AI Assistance Disclosure

Every commit produced with AI assistance carries a `Co-Authored-By: <name of the model that actually produced the commit> <noreply@anthropic.com>` trailer (the model changes between sessions, so no single name is fixed here; the repository's `.gitmessage` has the same rule). This is a factual disclosure of how the commit was produced - it is never stripped to make a commit look human-authored, and never added where it doesn't apply to fake the opposite. If you use AI assistance in your own contributions, disclose it the same way.

### Code Style

- **TypeScript:** strict mode, explicit types for all public APIs
- **Rust:** `cargo fmt` + `cargo clippy` (zero warnings)
- **CSS:** Tailwind utilities + custom design tokens
- **Comments:** only when the *why* is non-obvious - no narration of what the code does

### Smart Contract Changes

Contract modifications require:
1. Updated unit tests in `contracts/tests/`
2. Updated mock contracts if interfaces change
3. Security review note in the PR description
4. Confirmation that `cargo clippy` and `cargo audit` pass
