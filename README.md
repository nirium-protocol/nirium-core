> **⚠️ MANDATORY LEGAL DISCLAIMER**
>
> Nirium is **experimental software**. Nirium's own **NiriumVault** treasury contract remains on **Stellar Testnet, audit-gated**: no independent third-party audit has occurred yet, and no real client funds ever reach that contract.
>
> The **autonomous treasury node runs on mainnet over a DeFindex vault the client owns**: a third-party contract audited by OtterSec, not ours. Nirium holds only the vault's `RebalanceManager` role, which by the contract's own design cannot withdraw funds, change roles, or pause anything. Autonomous rebalancing on mainnet is **invite-only** while a legal review closes. A separate set of receive-only nodes (x402 micropayments, MPP Charge, IPFS audit anchoring, non-custodial Payouts, Reporting) also run in **mainnet early access**; several move real USDC under the client's own wallet signature — see the evidence table below for which ones, and MPP Charge's current status specifically. **Nirium never custodies funds.**
>
> **Update, 2026-10-08 (checked against the live `/api/tickers` on both networks that day):** until today the site, the API and the docs showed a CETES rate of 5.57% under labels such as "Banxico ref", "Today" and, on one dashboard card, "LIVE". It was a fixed reference value read once from app.etherfuse.com/b/cetes in June 2026, not a live reading and not from Banxico. The labels are corrected; the value itself is unchanged and still not live. The same release stops publishing `1 / xlmPrice` as the USDC price in `/api/tickers`: that figure (about 5.25) was how many XLM one dollar buys, and is now `null`.
>
> **Nirium is not financial advice. It is not an investment product. It does not guarantee yields, dividends, asset appreciation, or returns of any kind.** Reference rate data shown on the dashboard (Blend supply rate, Etherfuse CETES rate) is **public protocol information only**, not projections or promises of return. XLM and Stellar assets are volatile. Smart contracts carry risk even when audited. Use at your own risk.
>
> This project does not use grant funds for speculation, trading, investment advice, or marketing of products promising interest or appreciation, in accordance with the [Stellar Community Fund Official Rules](https://stellar.gitbook.io/scf-handbook/scf-awards/official-rules-for-submissions).

**Nirium is an Infrastructure-as-Software provider**: autonomous treasury and agentic payments (x402; MPP experimental) on Stellar/Soroban, not a consumer dashboard.

**The hero product is the rail, not the data.** An 86-endpoint API and TypeScript/Python SDKs that let any B2B fintech both *pay* for machine-to-machine services and *charge* for its own, plus autonomous execution nodes that run treasury operations 24/7 without manual CFO intervention.

### Execution Nodes

| # | Node | Status | Network | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Settlement** (x402 active; MPP Charge experimental) | x402 ✅ Active · MPP ⚠️ Experimental | both | Per-request micropayments for AI agents. Pay for others' APIs with `initX402()` today — x402 has confirmed mainnet settlements (see the evidence table below). MPP Charge is implemented but experimental: verified on testnet on 15 Oct 2026 with settled payments in pull and push mode (it had rejected a valid payment on 1 Oct); mainnet is unverified. **Update, 2026-10-07:** this previously said charging for your own with `x402Serve()` was invite-only, same gate as Treasury and Payouts — there is no such gate. `x402Serve()` is a general-purpose library that runs on the integrator's own server; Nirium does not operate or gate it. Legal review of third-party use is open — compliance is the integrator's own responsibility. |
| 2 | **Audit Trail** | ✅ Active | both | Evidence anchored to IPFS as immutable receipts, optionally **signed by the agent that produced it** (ed25519 over a domain-separated statement), so the CID proves not just *that* a fact is unaltered but *who declared it*. |
| 3 | **Payouts** | ✅ Active | both | Non-custodial batch disbursements, up to 100 recipients per transaction. Mainnet is invite-only; independent service payments only (contractors, freelancers, B2B); never subordinate-employee salary. A milestone variant (Trustless Work Multi-Release — one contract, a distinct receiver per milestone) runs on testnet: `GET /api/payroll/escrow/info`. |
| 4 | **Treasury Rebalance** | ✅ Active | both | Moves idle capital into a CETES strategy and back, on its own, over a **DeFindex vault the client owns**. Live on mainnet, invite-only during legal review. |
| 5 | **Reporting** | ✅ Active | both | Institutional-format summaries and CSV/JSON exports over anchored receipts. Read-only; regulatory filings remain the client's responsibility. |
| 6 | **Compliance Sentinel** | 🟡 Proposed | testnet | Not built. The intent is to validate every proposed transfer against a policy before it is signed. What exists today is the agent-to-agent x402 client pattern in `coordinationService`; the auditor endpoint it calls does not exist yet, and the call fails open by design so a downed auditor never blocks execution. Do not rely on this as a control. |

The framework supports up to 10 nodes per vault. Live catalog: `GET /api/nodes`.

Every claim below is a link. Nothing here asks to be believed.

A 2026-10-01 end-to-end test found the testnet box rejecting real payment proofs with `verification-failed`, including a push flow where the payment settled on-chain but the content was never delivered; the root cause was not determined. No MPP Charge-tagged credit appears anywhere in the mainnet recipient's payment history, past or since. **Update, 2026-10-15:** re-tested with `nirium@0.16.1` against the testnet box: `pull` and `push` both settled and delivered, so the 1 Oct failure no longer reproduces.

### Signed audit evidence (anyone can verify with only the CID)

Each document carries an ed25519 signature over `nirium-audit-v1:<content_sha256>`, so the CID proves not only that the fact is unaltered, but **who declared it**.

| Document | CID |
|---|---|
| Milestone attestation | [`QmYNvmR7C5Fivm7G1THbo5qd7jCp1nYoWMDkbmBmHibYvk`](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmYNvmR7C5Fivm7G1THbo5qd7jCp1nYoWMDkbmBmHibYvk) · **Update, 2026-10-07:** this CID returned 404 on two checks against the Pinata gateway, so it is not currently retrievable from there. |
| Dispute attestation | [`QmSSZdtt3dQ8BqUm62zrKQ85E4BUHYiVfvDgZmHfJsqU1U`](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmSSZdtt3dQ8BqUm62zrKQ85E4BUHYiVfvDgZmHfJsqU1U) · **Update, 2026-10-07:** the Pinata gateway answered 404 on one check and 200 on another, so availability is intermittent. Verify before relying on this link. |

> **The two networks are not two copies of the same thing.** Testnet is where the agent holds a key and rebalances on demand. That is the demonstration. Mainnet is where real value moves, and there the API box holds **no key at all**: a separate process with no HTTP surface signs the rebalances, and every fund movement a client makes is signed by the client. Never quote a testnet figure as if it were mainnet: deploying a vault costs ~0.038 XLM on testnet and ~1.4 XLM on mainnet, 47× more.

---

## The Treasury Node: how an agent moves someone else's money without being able to take it

This is the part that took the longest to get right, and it is worth stating precisely because the safety does not come from our promises.

The client deploys a **DeFindex vault** (a third-party Soroban contract) with their own signature. That vault has four roles:

| Role | Held by | Can do |
|---|---|---|
| Manager | **the client** | everything: pause, rescue, change roles |
| Emergency Manager | **the client** | emergency stop |
| Fee Receiver | **the client** | collect the vault fee (we set it to 0) |
| **RebalanceManager** | **Nirium** | `rebalance()` and nothing else |

`rebalance()` accepts four instructions: `Invest`, `Unwind`, `SwapExactIn`, `SwapExactOut`. **None of them takes a destination address**: `to` is hardcoded to the vault itself in every branch. Withdrawal is not *forbidden*, it is **inexpressible**. This was verified by reading DeFindex's source (not its docs) and confirmed by submitting real transactions: Soroban's simulator *records* `require_auth()` without verifying signatures, so simulating gives a false pass.

The client can call `set_rebalance_manager` and remove us unilaterally, without notice, and we cannot stop them.

**Verified on mainnet, with real funds:**

| Step | Who signs | Transaction |
|---|---|---|
| Deploy vault | the client | [`93ff6284…78416`](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/tx/93ff6284cdf03706624c88434a79fba1b213ee547f58e09a9248f75373178416) |
| Invest into strategy | **the agent** | [`82d73f53…6b3d4`](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/tx/82d73f537e907140367f9343f63a36704c74a5286aced7a938cee8fffb56b3d4) |

That second transaction is the whole argument turned into evidence: the agent moved someone else's funds, and the contract gave it no way to take them out.

**Audit scope, stated honestly:** the vault is DeFindex, audited by OtterSec (March 2025, 16 findings, all 13 vulnerabilities resolved), running a Blend V2 strategy (3 independent audits). The deployed WASM matches the public 1.0.0 release. What is *not* covered is the Etherfuse pool as an external dependency and each instance's configuration. **Fees:** Nirium takes no percentage of your capital; DeFindex, the protocol behind the vault, takes 20% of the yield it generates.

The mainnet signer is a **separate process with its own key and no HTTP surface**: the mainnet API box holds no signing key at all, by design, and enforces it at startup.

## Market Traction: Developer Adoption & Verifiable On-Chain Activity

Traction is **self-generated and independently verifiable**. It does not depend on third-party announcements:

- **Published SDKs** on npm and PyPI (`nirium`) with recorded downloads across multiple versions.
- **Live autonomous agent** running 24/7 on Stellar Testnet, every rebalance verifiable on Stellar Expert.
- **Real mainnet activity**: x402 micropayments settling in production, and a full treasury cycle executed with real funds (hashes above).
- **Open API + free sandbox keys**, so any developer can integrate and exercise the contracts directly.
- **Real upstream engagement** — issues we filed and fixes we shipped against the
  Stellar and x402 ecosystems, most recent first. Every row links to the public thread;
  status is as of 2026-10-22 — the two most recent rows were verified live that day
  against the GitHub API, the rest were re-verified 2026-10-12 and carry their own
  row-by-row status.

  | Protocol 28 | [OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts#865](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts/issues/865) | A non-exhaustive `match` on `ContractExecutable` in production code that compiles clean today but fails to build (`error[E0004]`, reproduced against the real compiler) the day the crate's soroban-sdk pin moves to 28.x — ahead of the 2026-09-16 mainnet vote. | **Fixed by the maintainer** ([#866](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts/pull/866), `fix #865`, merged 2026-09-26): `get_validated_context_by_id` now handles `ContractExecutable::ExternalRef`, and `main` pins stable `soroban-sdk` 28.0.0. Reported 2026-09-02, closed as completed 2026-09-26. |
  | 2026-08 | [x402-foundation/x402#3171](https://github.com/x402-foundation/x402/issues/3171) | Reported a crash in `@x402/core` when `payload.accepted` is null/undefined. | **Fixed** — external contributor JasonColapietro wrote and merged [#3180](https://github.com/x402-foundation/x402/pull/3180). |
  | 2026-08 | [stellar/stellar-dev-skill#96](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-dev-skill/pull/96) | Add Nirium to the Foundation's community developer-skills catalog. | **Merged.** |
  | 2026-08 | [OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts#840](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts/issues/840) | Read the fee-abstraction Lazy-mode expiration check as validating the wrong value; proposed a fix ([#844](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/stellar-contracts/pull/844)). | Closed — maintainer treats the Lazy-mode value as intended behavior. Our reading, corrected by theirs. |
  | 2026-08 | [x402-foundation/x402#3148](https://github.com/x402-foundation/x402/issues/3148) | Original header claim was corrected by a reviewer; reframed as a proposal for a payment-rejection reason-code vocabulary, grounded in five measured failure modes from production integrators. | Open, awaiting maintainer response on the proposal. |
- **A real integrator's own words**, not solicited copy:

  > "We verify everything a 402 claims, whoever it comes from, and with Nirium it all checked out... And when things did come up, they got resolved fast. They warned us about a risk in our integration — that the collection account rotated on mainnet — before it bit us, and the bugs we reported were fixed the same day, not in the next release. That tells me more than any number on a landing page."
  > — Fer, AgentLedger

We provide the middleware; regulated operators (e.g. Etherfuse) hold the licenses and execute settlement. We are open to integration conversations with regional fintechs. We have **two signed letters of intent**: Pollar (2026-10-08) and Trustless Work (October 2026, the letter carries no day). A letter of intent states what each side means to build; **it is not a pilot, a paid engagement, or production use**, and we make no claim of signed pilots.

  **Update, 2026-10-12:** this sentence previously read only "make no claim of signed pilots". That was still true, but it left out the two letters of intent. The Pollar date is the signing date; the Trustless Work letter is dated only by month. Neither counterparty is running Nirium in production today.

## Core Features

### Institutional API (86 endpoints: 85 HTTP + 1 WebSocket)

Multi-tier authentication with sandbox accounts, self-service API keys (`/keys`, wallet-signed via SEP-53), tiers (free/sandbox/institutional/enterprise), and JWT for WebSocket. Full RBAC, sliding-window rate limiting. **Update, 2026-10-07:** this previously also said "AML checks, and domain lock" as live controls. Neither was ever mounted on any route - the AML middleware has been removed as dead code, and the domainLock/obfuscation modules remain in the repo, unused.

| Access level | Endpoints |
|---|---|
| Public (no key) | health, loop/status, execute-demo, signals/recent, skills, nodes, netdiag |
| Protected (API key) | execute, market, tickers, stats, loop control, webhooks, subscriptions, skills/install, payroll/\*, treasury/\* |
| Paid (x402 / MPP) | premium/\*, mpp/\* |
| WebSocket (JWT) | `/ws/signals`, real-time signal stream |
| Admin only | system/health, config/llm |

**Endpoints charge where the capability exists, not where it reads better.** The mainnet box holds no signing key and runs no autonomous loop, so `premium/signals` and `premium/execute` return `501` there instead of charging for an empty answer. `premium/market` charges and delivers on both networks.

Full specification: [API_DOCUMENTATION_OPENAPI.yaml](API_DOCUMENTATION_OPENAPI.yaml)

### Autonomous On-Chain Execution (Soroban)

Strategies dispatched to the NiriumVault contract on testnet, all verifiable on Stellar Expert:

- `flash-loan-arb` / `flash-loan` → `flash_loan_execute`: atomic flash loans with automatic revert on non-repayment
- `path-arbitrage` / `path-vector` → `execute_path_arbitrage`: path payment discovery for XLM-USDC corridors
- `cross-dex` → `execute_cross_dex`: cross-venue routing
- `blend-yield` → `execute_blend_yield`: non-custodial allocation on Blend Protocol
- `soroswap-swap` → `execute_soroswap_swap`: multi-hop execution with minimum-slippage enforcement

The mainnet treasury path does **not** go through this router. It goes through the client-owned DeFindex vault described above.

### x402 + MPP + MCP

Any AI agent (Claude, GPT, custom) can access Nirium's premium data **per request** by paying USDC on Stellar: no account, no subscription. Adopted on launch day alongside emerging industry standards:

- x402 integrated April 2, 2026: same day as the Linux Foundation x402 Foundation launch
- MPP integrated April 3, 2026: 16 days after the spec was published (March 18, 2026)

**Both directions are supported.** `initX402()` pays for someone else's API, live today. `x402Serve()` charges for yours. **Update, 2026-10-07:** this previously said third-party facilitator use was invite-only, same gate as Treasury and Payouts — there is no such gate. `x402Serve()` is a general-purpose library that runs on the integrator's own server; Nirium does not operate or gate it. Legal review of third-party use is open — compliance is the integrator's own responsibility:

```typescript
import { x402Serve } from 'nirium';

app.use('/premium', x402Serve({
    payTo: 'G...',
    routes: { 'GET /signals': '$0.02' },
}));
```

**MPP Charge is experimental**: implemented and verified on testnet (settled payments in pull and push mode, 15 Oct 2026); mainnet is unverified. Its design: the client signs a complete USDC transfer inside the request, the server validates it by simulation and broadcasts it, with no external facilitator. MPP's Channel mode is implemented but **disabled**, because its setup phase deploys a channel contract holding a deposit, which is temporary custody and falls under the same audit gate as our own vault.

The MCP server exposes Nirium as **25 tools** for Claude Desktop, Cursor, and any MCP-compatible IDE: 10 free, 9 authenticated, 1 informational, 3 paid over x402, 2 MPP tools (experimental).

### Audit Trail Engine

```
Agent action or third-party event
    → SHA-256 content hash
    → optional agent attestation: ed25519 signature over
      "nirium-audit-v1:<content_sha256>"  (domain-separated on purpose:
      without it, a signature made for a login could be replayed as evidence)
    → pinned to IPFS, CID returned
    → verifiable by anyone holding only the CID
```

An invalid signature returns **400 and nothing is anchored**: IPFS has no delete, so a false attestation would be permanent. Third-party apps anchor through `POST /api/audit/log`. Anchor **hashes, not raw personal data**.

### Live Market Ticker (Reference Data)

> *Public protocol information. Not investment advice and not a return projection.*

| Ticker | Source | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **XLM/USDC** | Reflector → CoinGecko → Stellar Expert | Multi-tier oracle price feed |
| **SDEX spread** | Stellar Horizon orderbook | Live XLM/USDC spread in basis points |
| **Blend rate** | Blend Protocol on-chain | Liquidity reference rate |
| **CETES rate** | Etherfuse (fixed reference) | **Fixed** reference value 5.57%, read 2026-06 from app.etherfuse.com/b/cetes; not updated live |
| **Base fee** | Stellar Horizon | Live network base fee |

### Published SDKs (npm + PyPI)

| SDK | Package | Version | Install |
|---|---|---|---|
| TypeScript | [nirium (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nirium) | 0.16.1 | `npm install nirium` |
| Python | [nirium (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/nirium/) | 0.11.0 | `pip install nirium` |

> The two SDKs share full Treasury parity (12 methods, `proposeTreasuryRebalance()`/`propose_treasury_rebalance()` included) since 10-sep-2026. `x402Serve()` stays TypeScript-only — it's Express middleware, server-side Node, with no meaningful equivalent in an async Python client. Going the other way, Python ships a resilient, auto-reconnecting WebSocket client (backoff, jitter, dedup) and a LangChain `BaseTool` (`pip install nirium[langchain]`) that TypeScript doesn't have yet — the gap runs both directions, not just one.

| MCP server | [nirium-mcp (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nirium-mcp) | 0.6.0 | `npx nirium-mcp` |
| Pollar adapter | [nirium-pollar-adapter (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nirium-pollar-adapter) | 0.4.1 | `npm install nirium-pollar-adapter` |

```typescript
import { Agent } from 'nirium';
const agent = new Agent({ apiKey: 'sk_inst_...', baseUrl: 'https://nirium-agent.fly.dev' });

const market = await agent.getMarket();
const nodes = await agent.getNodes();
await agent.anchorAuditRecord({ hash: '...' });
agent.subscribe(signal => console.log(signal));
```

```python
from nirium import Agent
agent = Agent(api_url="https://nirium-agent.fly.dev", api_key="sk_inst_...")

market = await agent.get_market()
await agent.anchor_audit_record(hash="...")
async for signal in agent.listen():
    print(signal)
```

## Security

- **Internal self-review only. No external audit and no penetration test has been done.** The report lists method, findings, fixes and what was left out; it carries no score and no certification.
- Methodology: static analysis (`cargo clippy`, grep), runtime checks on testnet, `cargo audit` + `pnpm audit` in CI, fuzz smoke runs (5 cargo-fuzz targets), manual code review
- **Update, 2026-10-12 (checked against `INTERNAL_SECURITY_AUDIT.md` and CI that day):** this section previously stated "83/83 vectors checked" and named the method "full-spectrum pentesting". The score and that label were removed: no pentest was performed and a pass count over our own checklist is not evidence an outside reader can check.
- A formal independent audit is planned before any mainnet deployment of **NiriumVault**. The mainnet nodes running today do not depend on it: they either never touch funds (x402, audit, reporting), or the client signs every fund movement themselves (Payouts), or they operate a **third-party contract already audited by OtterSec** in a role that cannot withdraw (Treasury).
- The mainnet API box holds **no signing key**, enforced at startup. The autonomous mainnet signer is a separate process with no HTTP surface.
- See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for responsible disclosure, and [INTERNAL_SECURITY_AUDIT.md](INTERNAL_SECURITY_AUDIT.md) for the full report.

## Stellar Code of Conduct Alignment

Nirium operates in alignment with the [Stellar Code of Conduct](https://stellar.org/foundation/code-of-conduct).

| Principle | Nirium status |
|---|---|
| Stellar must be **core and valuable**, not auxiliary | ✅ Soroban contracts, SDEX, Blend, DeFindex, x402; MPP experimental; Stellar is the execution layer |
| No speculation, wash trading, or insider trading with grant funds | ✅ Grant funds allocated to development, not trading |
| No investment advice or yield promises | ✅ Prominent disclaimer; rates displayed as protocol reference data only |
| No marketing promising interest, dividends, or appreciation | ✅ Language focuses on workflow automation, not guaranteed returns |
| Open source, contracts and SDKs publicly available | ✅ Soroban contracts + TypeScript SDK + Python SDK in the public repo |
| Transparency | ✅ Every protocol action auditable on-chain via Stellar Expert |
| Integrity | ✅ No front-running or predatory extraction |
| Safety | ✅ Non-custodial by design; the user is the sole custodian of their keys |

To report violations: [community@stellar.org](mailto:community@stellar.org)

### SCF Instawards

Nirium received two Stellar Community Fund Instawards, through the Stellar Ambassador Program (a regional chapter assists the submission), with full KYC complete (Airtable + Persona + W-8BEN). Instawards are SCF's early-stage awards for prototyping and local validation, up to $15,000 per project. More info: [communityfund.stellar.org](https://communityfund.stellar.org)

**Update, 2026-10-12:** this section was titled "SCF Kickstart" and described the awards under that name. Sources, read from the SCF handbook (`stellar/scf-handbook`) on 2026-10-12: `additional-support/history-of-scf.md` says SCF Kickstart is the former Startup Camp (a bootcamp), not the awards program; `scf-awards/instawards/README.md` describes Instawards as offered through local Stellar Ambassador Chapters.

| Treasury node on mainnet over a client-owned DeFindex vault | ✅ Live, invite-only during legal review |
| Legal opinion on the treasury node (MX + cross-border) | 🔄 In progress: gates opening it beyond invite-only |
| Etherfuse, enterprise KYB onboarding | 🔄 In progress |
| Stellar Community Fund Build Award | 🔄 Building verifiable third-party traction before applying |
| Formal independent audit of NiriumVault | Planned, ahead of any NiriumVault mainnet deployment |
| NiriumVault mainnet deployment (real treasury funds) | Post formal audit |

## External Credentials

- **3rd place, Fintech World Cup Mexico 2026**: Sui Loop (founder's prior project; architecture migrated to Nirium on Stellar)
- **Stellar Community Fund Instawards (2)**, via the Stellar Ambassador Program; full KYC complete (Airtable + Persona + W-8BEN)
- **Update, 2026-10-12 (checked against this repository):** this list previously included "Stellar Scale / Kickstart: 83/100 Bootcamp Impact; active graduate with ongoing SDF mentorship". The line was removed because it could not be verified (no source for the 83/100 figure or for an SDF mentorship), not reworded.
- **Etherfuse**: active technical integration (CETES on testnet + SPEI sandbox); enterprise KYB onboarding in progress

*Nirium Protocol: experimental software. Not financial advice. NiriumVault is testnet-only and audit-gated; the mainnet treasury node runs over a client-owned, third-party audited DeFindex vault in a role that cannot withdraw. Updated August 28, 2026.*
